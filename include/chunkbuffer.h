/**

 *
 * @brief This is the chunk buffer of the peer.
 * 
 * The chunks buffer is responsible for storing the chunks received by a
 * peer. Each chunk is stored until the chunk buffer decides to discard it
 * (for example, when some kind of playout delay is expired), then it
 * is removed from the buffer. The buffer makes its chunks available to
 * the output module and to the scheduler, in form of an ordered list (chunks
 * are ordered by timestamp). Since every chunk has a timestamp and a
 * sequence number (the chunk ID), the chunk buffer's clients
 * (scheduler and output module) can easily check if there are gaps in the
 * list.
 * See @link cb_test.c cb_test.c @endlink for an usage example
 *
