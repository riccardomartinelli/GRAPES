 * @brief Chunk Delivery API - Lower Abstraction
 *
 * The Chunk Delivery LA provides the primitives to encode the send operation of a Chunk to a target Peer and decode the Chunk reception from a Peer. The former returns a bit stream obteined by the encoding of the Chunk to send, it is the packet that will be sent. The latter decode a packet received, the bit stream, in the corresponding Chunk.
 * See @link chunk_encoding_test.c chunk_encoding_test.c @endlink for an usage example
